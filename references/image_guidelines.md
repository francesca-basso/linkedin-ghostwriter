# Image Selection Guidelines — LinkedIn Ghostwriter

Images on LinkedIn are not decoration.  
They are attention amplifiers.

The goal is not aesthetics — it is authority + clarity + scroll-stopping power.

This guideline defines how to evaluate and suggest images for LinkedIn posts.

## The 5-Priority Scoring System

Each image is evaluated from 1 to 5 across five dimensions.

Total score: /25

### 1. Clarity (1–5)

Is the image immediately understandable on mobile?

5 → Clean, high contrast, readable at small size  
3 → Some visual noise but still usable  
1 → Cluttered, dark, blurry, confusing  

Questions:
- Can I understand it in 2 seconds?
- Would it still work as a small thumbnail?

---

### 2. Human Presence (1–5)

Does the image contain a real human?

LinkedIn is relational. Faces outperform objects.

5 → Clear face, strong expression, eye contact  
3 → Human present but secondary  
1 → No human element  

Exception: Data-heavy or technical audiences may perform well with charts instead.

---

### 3. Authority Signal (1–5)

Does the image reinforce credibility?

Authority signals include:
- Stage speaking
- Whiteboard thinking
- Office / professional setting
- Conference badge
- Screenshot of product with context

5 → Strong authority context  
3 → Neutral  
1 → Casual / unrelated to topic  

Avoid:
- Generic stock photos
- Fake laptop coffee desk clichés
- Overly staged influencer poses

---

### 4. Mobile Readability (1–5)

If there is text in the image:

5 → Large, bold, minimal words (≤ 6 words)  
3 → Readable but slightly dense  
1 → Paragraph text, impossible to read on phone  

Rules:
- No more than 6–8 words on image
- High contrast (dark on light or light on dark)
- Avoid thin fonts

---

### 5. Content Coherence (1–5)

Does the image actually match the post content?

5 → Directly reinforces the message  
3 → Loosely connected  
1 → Clickbait / unrelated  

Example:
Post about hiring culture → image of team discussion (coherent)
Post about SaaS metrics → random sunset (incoherent)

---

## Score Interpretation

21–25 → Strong asset, use it  
16–20 → Usable with minor tweaks  
11–15 → Weak, consider replacing  
≤10 → Do not use  

---

## Caption Strategy

Images should never repeat the post verbatim.

Good captions:
- Add context
- Add nuance
- Add tension

Bad captions:
- "Me speaking at a conference"
- "Another great event"
- "Grateful 🙏"

---

## Crop & Overlay Suggestions

When suggesting improvements:

- Tight crop on face for emotional impact
- Remove empty margins
- Increase contrast slightly
- Add minimal overlay text (max 4–6 words)
- Use brand-consistent color

Never:
- Add heavy filters
- Add emoji overlays
- Add paragraph text

---

## When NOT to Use an Image

Skip images when:

- The hook alone is strong enough
- The post is purely opinion-driven
- The image would distract from the message
- The image lowers authority

Text-only posts often outperform image posts on LinkedIn.

---

## Carousel Suggestion Pattern

If recommending a carousel:

Slide 1 → Bold statement (big text, 3–5 words)  
Slide 2–4 → Structured insights  
Final Slide → Question or takeaway  

Keep slides minimal.
Whitespace is a feature.

---

## Final Rule

An image should amplify authority.

If it feels like decoration, remove it.
